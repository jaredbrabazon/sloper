Description: This package takes the slope of the line containing the two points 
	(x1,y1) and (x2,y2). The slope is calculated by m = (y2-y1)/(x2-x1). 
	The result is printed to the console. A graph is plotted showing the 
	two points and the line connecting those points. A title on the top 
	of the plot shows the value for the slope.
